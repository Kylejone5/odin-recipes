    <h4>Steps</h4>

        <ol>
           
            <li>Prep and make sauce</li>
                <img src="../img/step-one-3.webp" width="600" height="400" alt="Prep and make sauce">
                    <p>Before starting, preheat the oven to 450°F. Wash and dry all produce. Add 1 1/2 cups water and 1/8 tsp salt (dbl for 4 ppl) to a medium pot. Cover and bring to a boil over high heat. While water comes to a boil, peel, then cut carrot into 1/4-inch slices, then cut slices into 1/4-inch matchsticks. Halve zucchini lengthwise, then cut into 1/4-inch half-moons. Thinly slice green onions. Stir together gochujang, half the honey and half the soy sauce in a medium bowl.</p>            
            
            <li>Cook rice</li>
                <img src="../img/step-two-3.webp" width="600" height="400" alt="Cook rice">
                    <p>Add rice to the boiling water. Reduce heat to low. Cover and cook until rice is tender and liquid is absorbed, 12-14 min. Remove the pot from heat. Set aside, still covered.</p>            
            
            <li>Roast veggies</li>
                <img src="../img/step-three-3.webp" width="600" height="400" alt="Roast veggies">
                    <p>While rice cooks, add zucchini, carrots and 1 tbsp oil (dbl for 4 ppl) to a parchment-lined baking sheet. Season with salt and pepper, then toss to combine. Roast in the middle of the oven until tender-crisp, 8-10 min.</p>            
            
            <li>Toast sesame seeds</li>
                <img src="../img/step-four-3.webp" width="600" height="400" alt="Toast sesame seeds">
                    <p>While veggies roast, heat a large non-stick pan over medium heat. When hot, add sesame seeds to the dry pan. Toast, stirring often, until golden-brown, 4-5 min. (TIP: Keep your eye on them so they don't burn!) Transfer sesame seeds to a plate.</p>            
            <li>Cook beyond meat</li>
                <img src="../img/step-five-3.webp" width="600" height="400" alt="Cook beyond meat">
                    <p>Heat the same pan over medium-high. When hot, add 1/2 tbsp oil (dbl for 4 ppl), then Beyond Meat®. Cook, breaking up patties into bite-sized pieces, until slightly crispy, 5-6 min.** Remove the pan from heat, then add remaining soy sauce and remaining honey. Season with salt and pepper, then stir to combine.</p>

            <li>Finish and serve</li>
                <img src="../img/step-six-3.webp" width="600" height="400" alt="Finish and Serve">
                    <p>Stir half the sesame seeds into the medium bowl with sauce. Sprinkle remaining sesame seeds over veggies. Fluff rice with a fork. Season with salt and stir in half the green onions. Divide rice between bowls, then top with Beyond Meat® and veggies. Drizzle with spicy sesame sauce, then drizzle with sriracha, to taste. Sprinkle remaining green onions over top.</p>
